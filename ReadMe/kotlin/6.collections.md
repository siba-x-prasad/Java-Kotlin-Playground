# Collections
- List
- Set
- Map

- **A read-only** interface that provides operations for accessing collection elements.
- **A mutable** interface that extends the corresponding read-only interface with write operations: adding, removing, and updating its elements.

##  List 
- It is an ordered collection with access to elements by indices â€“ integer numbers that reflect their position. 
- Elements can occur more than once in a list. An example of a list is a telephone number: it's a group of digits, their order is important, and they can repeat.

- **Mutable List**
```
    val mutableList1 = mutableListOf<String>()
    var mutableList2 = ArrayList<String>()
```
- **Immutable List**
```
    val immutableList = listOf<String>()
```
## Set 
- It is a collection of unique elements. It reflects the mathematical abstraction of set: a group of objects without repetitions. 
- Generally, the order of set elements has no significance. 
- For example, the numbers on lottery tickets form a set: they are unique, and their order is not important.
- **Mutable Set**
```
    var set:Set<String> = hashSetOf<String>()
    var set:Set<String> = mutableSetOf()
```
- **Immutable Set**
```
    var immutableSet:Set<String> = setOf("Siba","satya","Siba","satya")
```
## Map (or dictionary) 
- It is a set of key-value pairs. Keys are unique, and each of them maps to exactly one value. 
- The values can be duplicates. Maps are useful for storing logical connections between objects, for example, an employee's ID and their position.
- **Mutable Map**
```
    var mutableMap = hashMapOf<Int,String>(1 to "Raju",2 to "Bangali", 3 to "Namita",
                    4 to "Sabita",5 to "satya", 6 to "Siba")
    var mutableMap = mutableMapOf<String,String>()

```
- **Immutable Map**
```
    var map = mapOf<Int,String>(1 to "Raju",2 to "Bangali", 3 to "Namita", 4 to "Sabita",5 to "satya", 6 to "Siba")
```
