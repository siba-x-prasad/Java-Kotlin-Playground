# Control Structures
## If Else clause
- In kotlin if else is same as in java
- In kotlin, if else can return a value
```
val num1 = 12, num2 = 13
val maxNum = if(num1 > num2){
    println("$num1 is greater than $num2")
    num1
}
else{
    println("$num2 is greater than $num1")
    num2
}
```
- We can add additional statement like print statement and other operations.num2

## when
- It is same as switch in java
- Using when clause you return value
- It's more dynamic as compared to switch
- You can add multiple condition in one case
```
when(value){
    case 1-> {
    }
    case 2-> {
        }
    case 3-> {
            }
    case 4-> {
              }
    else{
        // default condition
    }
}
```
- We can mention range, function etc in a case
- You can check the examles in conrolfo

## for loop
- for (item in collection) print(item)
- ```
    for (item: Int in ints) {
        // ...
    }
```

```
for (i in 1..3) {
println(i)
}
for (i in 6 downTo 0 step 2) {
println(i)
}
```
- You can check index in an array
```
for (i in array.indices) {
println(array[i])
}
```
-We can access index and value in for loop
```
for ((index, value) in array.withIndex()) {
println("the element at $index is $value")
}
```

## While and Do While Loop
- while and do-while loops execute their body continuously while their condition is satisfied. The difference between them is the condition checking time:
- while checks the condition and, if it's satisfied, executes the body and then returns to the condition check.
- do-while executes the body and then checks the condition. If it's satisfied, the loop repeats. So, the body of do-while executes at least once regardless of the condition.
```
while (x > 0) {
x--
}

do {
val y = retrieveData()
} while (y != null) // y is visible here!
```

## Returns and jumps
- Kotlin has three structural jump expressions:
- **return** by default returns from the nearest enclosing function or anonymous function.
- **break** terminates the nearest enclosing loop.
- **continue** proceeds to the next step of the nearest enclosing loop.
## Break and continue labels
- Any expression in Kotlin may be marked with a label.
- Labels have the form of an identifier followed by the @ sign, such as abc@ or fooBar@.
- To label an expression, just add a label in front of it.
```
loop@ for (i in 1..100) {
// ...
}

loopOuter@ for (i in 1..100) {
loopInner@ for (j in 1..100) {
if (i ==10) break@loopOuter
if (j ==10) break@loopInner
}
}
```
## Return to labels
- We can define return as label
```
fun foo() {
listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).forEach {
if (it == 3) return // non-local return directly to the caller of foo()
print(it)
}
println("this point is unreachable")
}
```
- Note that such non-local returns are supported only for lambda expressions passed to inline functions. To return from a lambda expression, label it and qualify the return:
```
fun foo() {
listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).forEach lit@{
if (it == 3) return@lit // local return to the caller of the lambda - the forEach loop
print(it)
}
print(" done with explicit label")
}
```
```
fun foo() {
listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).forEach {
if (it == 3) return@forEach // local return to the caller of the lambda - the forEach loop
print(it)
}
print(" done with implicit label")
}
```
