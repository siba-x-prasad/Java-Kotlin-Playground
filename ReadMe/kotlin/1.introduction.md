## What is kotlin

- It's a statically typed language
- It is a JVM language
- It needs java virtual machine to execute its bytecode.
- It's fully interoperable with java
- Support to avoid NullPointer exception
- Supports immutability
- Object-oriented Language
- Functional
  - You can pass a function as parameter to another function
  - Or, a function can return another function
- Less ceremony
  - No more boiler plates
  - Less code, more result
  - Code looks clean

## Evolution of Kotlin

- Started in july 2011
- Stable version February 2016
## Types od apps that can be built using Kotlin

- Serverside apps ( Spring Boot, Vert.x, JFX, ktor )
- Android Development
- Web development(Kotlin JS)
- Desktop Application ( Java FX, TornadoTX )
- Native Development  ( Kotlin/Native Library )
## Installation and setup
- Install Jdk
- download intelJ idea, and start using kotlin in the IDE

## Hello World
- Create a kotlin file

```
    fun main(args: Array<String>){
      print("Hello World")
    }
```

- Java demands class files
- Kotlin needs JVM in runtime similar to java
- Does Kotlin create a class internally
    - Yes, The kotlin compiler internally creates a class file which is loaded into memory for
      execution in runtime
- Once you will execute the kotlin file, it will create a .class file internally
- It will save inside out/production/projectname/filenamekt.class
- It's a compiled code which is auto generated

## How Java works
- TestClass.java is compiled by javac (Java compiler).
- Javac compiles Java source file into Java byte-code file as TestClass.class.
- Java byte-code file (TestClass.class) ends up in JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
- JVM understands byte-code and converts it into machine code, using JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler.
- The machine code is then fed to the memory and executed by computer’s central processing unit.
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** — engine which provides runtime environment for execution of Java code.
- **JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler** — type of compiler which does the compilation during the execution of a program (compiles the app when user opens it).

## How Kotlin works
- .kt file is compiled by Kotlin compiler
- It creates .class file which is nothing but the byte code which is interpreted by JVM
- That byte code executed by JVM
- For more details, here is the image below

- Does kotlin create a class internally ?
- Yes, The kotlin compiler internally creates a class file which is loaded into memory for execution in runtime.
- Let's create a Hello.kt kotlin file and while executing it converts to Hellokt.class file to execute the class file by JVM

## Advantage of Kotlin Over Java
- It's Completely Interoperable With Java
- It's (way) More Concise Than Java
  - This is not to mention all the other benefits that derive from code conciseness, including code that is:
      - Easier to maintain
      - Easier to read
      - Easier to apply changes to when needed
    - Some of Kotlin's features that are “responsible” for its code conciseness are:
      - Data classes ( data class MyData())
      - Smart casts (using as, as?, is, is?)
      - Type interface
      - Properties
- Safer Code
- It Comes With a Smarter and Safer Compiler
    - Detects errors at compile time, not at runtime, leveraging the “fail-fast” principle
    - Performs lots of checks, reducing runtime errors and the number of bugs in the code
- It's Easier to Maintain
- It's Been Created to Boost Your Productivity
    - Object declarations
    - Parameter values
    - Extension functions
- It “Spoils” You with Better Support for Functional Programming
- It Has Null in Its Type System

## Latest Kotlin Version 1.7.2

- Support for Kotlin K2 compiler plugins.
- The new compiler aims to speed up the development of new language features, unify all the
  platforms Kotlin supports, bring performance improvements, and provide an API for compiler
  extensions.
- all-open
- no-arg
- SAM with receiver
- Lombok
- AtomicFU
- jvm-abi-gen

## Kotlin Version 1.7.0

- The new Kotlin K2 compiler is in Alpha now, and it offers serious performance improvements. It is
  available only for the JVM, and none of the compiler plugins, including kapt, work with it.
- A new approach to the incremental compilation in Gradle. Incremental compilation is now also
  supported for changes made inside dependent non-Kotlin modules and is compatible with Gradle.
- We've stabilized opt-in requirement annotations, definitely non-nullable types, and builder
  inference.
- There's now an underscore operator for type args. You can use it to automatically infer a type of
  argument when other types are specified.
- This release allows implementation by delegation to an inlined value of an inline class. You can
  now create lightweight wrappers that do not allocate memory in most cases.

- For more details follow
- https://kotlinlang.org/docs/whatsnew17.html#new-kotlin-k2-compiler-for-the-jvm-in-alpha

## A multiplatform language
- Kotlin is a multiplatform language.
- JVM: Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, which means Kotlin works great with all existing Java code and libraries. It also allows companies to make a gradual migration from Java to Kotlin because Java code can access Kotlin code, too. At the same time, developers can use Kotlin as the only language for their projects without Java at all.
- Android: using Kotlin, you can create mobile applications for the most used operating system in the world.
- JS: Kotlin is also compatible with JavaScript, which enables you to develop client-side web applications and run them in a browser.
- Native: Kotlin code can be converted into a file that can be run on any OS such as Windows, Linux, iOS, and macOS.

## Basic Program
```
  fun main() {
      println("Hello, Kotlin!")
  }
  
  OR

  fun main(args: Array<String>) {
      println(args.contentToString())
  }
```
## Here are the DataType List and their Range
**Type**	     **Bit width*
 Double       64(Bit)
 Float        32(Bit)
 Long         64(Bit)
 Int          32(Bit)
 Short        16(Bit)
 Byte          8(Bit)

**NOTE:Underscores in numeric literals (since 1.1)**
- You can use underscores to make number constants more readable:
- *ForExample*

```
    val oneMillion = 1_000_000
    val creditCardNumber = 1234_5678_9012_3456L
    val socialSecurityNumber = 999_99_9999L
    val hexBytes = 0xFF_EC_DE_5E
    val bytes = 0b11010010_01101001_10010100_10010010
```

**NOTE :** Kotlin does not support implicit type conversion, It supports only explicit data
conversion
- For example

```
    var a:Int = 123
    var b:Long = a // it will show error
    var b:Long = a.ToLong() // it will execute successfully
```
## Every number type supports the following conversions:
**toByte(): Byte
toShort(): Short
toInt(): Int
toLong(): Long
toFloat(): Float
toDouble(): Double
toChar(): Char**
## Type Checks and Casts: 'is' and 'as'
- is and !is Operators
- We can check whether an object conforms to a given type at runtime by using the is operator or its negated form !is:

```
    if (obj is String) {
        print(obj.length)
    }
    
    if (obj !is String) { // same as !(obj is String)
        print("Not a String")
    }
    else {
        print(obj.length)
    }
```

## Type cast Operator as and as?
- **Unsafe cast operator as**
- val x: String = y as String
- **Safe Cast operator as?**
- val x: String? = y as String?
- **Nullable cast Operator as**
- val x: String? = y as? String
## Operators
- Here is the complete list of bitwise operations (available for Int and Long only):
- **shl(bits)** – signed shift left (Java's <<)
- **shr(bits)** – signed shift right (Java's >>)
- **ushr(bits)** – unsigned shift right (Java's >>>)
- **and(bits)** – bitwise and
- **or(bits)** – bitwise or
- **xor(bits)** – bitwise xor
- **inv()** – bitwise inversion

- Here is a short overview of what each function accepts and returns:

**SAME PARAMETER	DIFFERENT RESULT**
**it 	     also      	let
**this	    apply	    run, with**
- I was not particularly happy with the decision of standard library designers putting so many similar functions in, as they represent cognitive overload com.swasi.play.when analyzing the code. However, if you strictly use them for their intended purpose, they will state your intent and make the code more readable:

## Scope Functions
- For more details follow **https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/scope-functions.html**
## also
- additional processing on an object in a call chain

## apply
- post-construction configuration

## let
- conversion of value

## run

- execute lambdas with side effects and no result.

## with
- configure objects created somewhere else

## takeIf and takeUnless
- When called on an object with a predicate provided, takeIf returns this object if it matches the predicate. Otherwise, it returns null. So, takeIf is a filtering function for a single object.
- In turn, takeUnless returns the object if it doesn't match the predicate and null if it does. The object is available as a lambda argument (it).

- Be careful when using these functions to avoid potential problems. Do not use with on nullable variables.
- Avoid nesting apply, run, and with, as you will not know the current this. For nested also and
  let, use a named parameter instead of it for the same reason.
- Avoid it in long call chains, as it is not clear what it represents.
- For examples, please follow the link below
  **https://dzone.com/articles/examining-kotlins-also-apply-let-run-and-with-intentions**

**The operations on floating point numbers discussed in this section are:**

- Equality checks: a == b and a != b
- Comparison operators: a < b, a > b, a <= b, a >= b
- Range instantiation and range checks: a..b, x in a..b, x !in a..b

## Array

- Arrays in Kotlin are represented by the Array class, that has get and set functions (that turn
  into [] by operator overloading conventions), and size property, along with a few other useful
  member functions:
- Creates an Array<String> with values ["0", "1", "4", "9", "16"]
- val asc = Array(5, { i -> (i * i).toString() })

## String

- Now we can use """ for below

```
    val text = """
        for (c in "foo")
            print(c)
    """
```

- or this type of String also

```
val text = """
    |Tell me and I forget.
    |Teach me and I remember.
    |Involve me and I learn.
    |(Benjamin Franklin)
    """.trimMargin()
```

**Note** By default | is used as margin prefix, but you can choose another character and pass it as
a parameter, like trimMargin(">").

## Control Flow: if, when, for, while

## If Expression
- In Kotlin, if is an expression, i.e. it returns a value. Therefore there is no ternary operator (condition ? then : else), because ordinary if works fine in this role.
- For Example
// Traditional usage

```
    var max = a
    if (a < b) max = b
    
    // With else
    var max: Int
    if (a > b) {
        max = a
    } else {
        max = b
    }
```

## if As expression
```val max = if (a > b) a else b```
- if branches can be blocks, and the last expression is the value of a block:
```
val max = if (a > b) {
    print("Choose a")
    a
} else {
    print("Choose b")
    b
}
```
- **NOTE - If you're using if as an expression rather than a statement (for example, returning its value or assigning it to a variable), the expression is required to have an else branch. **

## WHEN
- When replace the switch statement of java. Now com.swasi.play.when is more flexible and more powerful as compared to Switch.
- Using **when** we can also compare more than one condition in one case
- Instead of switch case we use com.swasi.play.when clause in kotlin. When is more powerful and dynamic in nature as compared to switch. We can declare multiple conditions in one case. The syntax is as follows

```
    when(value){
        case 1 ->{
            
        }
        case 2->{
            
        }
        else{
            // this is nothing but the default condition in switch case
        }
    }
```
- Example

```
    when(a){
        in 1..10 ->{
            print(" $a is in the range 1 to 10")
        }
        a is String ->{
            print(" $a is a string")
        }
        else {
            print(" none of the above condition")
        }
    }
```
- One more example with return type.
```
fun describe(obj: Any): String =
    when (obj) {
        1          -> "One"
        "Hello"    -> "Greeting"
        is Long    -> "Long"
        !is String -> "Not a string"
        else       -> "Unknown"
    }
```
- this com.swasi.play.when clause will return a string.

## For Example
-

```
    when (x) {
        1 -> print("x == 1")
        2 -> print("x == 2")
        else -> { // Note the block
            print("x is neither 1 nor 2")
        }
    }
    
    when (x) {
        0, 1 -> print("x == 0 or x == 1")
        else -> print("otherwise")
    }
```
- We can use arbitrary expressions (not only constants) as branch conditions
```
when (x) {
    parseInt(s) -> print("s encodes x")
    else -> print("s does not encode x")
}
```
- We can also check a value for being in or !in a range or a collection:
```
when (x) {
    in 1..10 -> print("x is in the range")
    in validNumbers -> print("x is valid")
    !in 10..20 -> print("x is outside the range")
    else -> print("none of the above")
}
```
## For Loops
- for loop iterates through anything that provides an iterator. This is equivalent to the foreach loop in languages like C#. The syntax is as follows:
- ```for (item in collection) print(item)```
- The body can be a block.

```
    for (item: Int in ints) {
        // ...
    }
```
- You can use range operator

```
    for (i in 1..3) {
        println(i)
    }
```
- You can use reverse and step as well

```
    for (i in 6 downTo 0 step 2) {
        println(i)
    }

    //sampleStart
    for (i in array.indices) {
        println(array[i])
    }
```
- You can iterate index and value of a array

```
    val array = arrayOf("a", "b", "c")
    
    //sampleStart
    for ((index, value) in array.withIndex()) {
        println("the element at $index is $value")
    }
```
## Return And Jumps
- **return** By default returns from the nearest enclosing com.swasi.play.function or anonymous function.
- **break** Terminates the nearest enclosing loop.
- **continue** Proceeds to the next step of the nearest enclosing loop.

## Break and Continue Labels

```
    loop@ for (i in 1..100) {
        for (j in 1..100) {
            if (...) break@loop
        }
    }
```
- Labeled break

```
    fun foo() {
        listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).forEach lit@{
            if (it == 3) return@lit // local return to the caller of the lambda, i.e. the forEach loop
            print(it)
        }
        print(" done with explicit label")
    }
```
## Function
- In kotlin function is defined using **fun** keyword.

```
    fun displayName(){
        print("Hello Kotlin")
    }
```
- Function with return type

```
    fun getName() : String ?{
        return "Sibaprasad"
    }
```

- We can convert the above function to single expression function

```
    fun getName() = "Sibaprasad"
```

- In this case compiiler understands that this is a single expression function, and return type will
  be the type of the datatype that returns

## Named Argument Function

When calling a function, you can name one or more of its arguments. This may be helpful when a
function has a large number of arguments, and it's difficult to associate a value with an argument,
especially if it's a boolean or null value.

```
    fun reformat(
        str: String,
        normalizeCase: Boolean = true,
        upperCaseFirstLetter: Boolean = true,
        divideByCamelHumps: Boolean = false,
        wordSeparator: Char = ' ',
    ) {
        /*...*/
    }
```    

- While calling the function

```
    reformat(
        'String!',
        false,
        upperCaseFirstLetter = false,
        divideByCamelHumps = true,
        '_'
    )
```

## Infix FUnction

- It is a member function or extension function
- It contains only one parameter
- It will have prefix infix
- All infix function are extension function but all extension function are not infix function.

```
    // extension function
    fun Int.greaterValue(other:Int):Int{
        if(this > other){
            return this
        }
        else
            return other
    }
    val x = 10
    val y = 20
    val greaterValue = x.greaterValue(y)
```

- The above example is extension function, for this we need to pas the parameter to the function
- Let's convert the above method to infix function. And see what are the benefits of infix function

```
    // extension function
    infix fun Int.greaterValue(other:Int):Int{
        if(this > other){
            return this
        }
        else
            return other
    }
    val x = 10
    val y = 20
    
    val greaterValue = x greaterValue y
```

- While calling an infix function, you don't need to pass parameters, you can use space instead.

## Lambda expressions and Anonymous function
- A function without name is called anonymous function.
- For lambda expression we can say that it is anonymous function.
- For more details
  Follow **https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kotlin-lambdas-expressions-and-anonymous-functions/?ref=lbp**
- Syntax

```
    val lambda_name : Data_type = { argument_List -> code_body }
    example
        val sum = {a: Int , b: Int -> a + b}
        val sum:(Int,Int) -> Int = { a, b -> a + b}
```

- A lambda expression is always surrounded by curly braces, argument declarations go inside curly
  braces and have optional type annotations, the code_body goes after an arrow -> sign. If the
  inferred return type of the lambda is not Unit, then the last expression inside the lambda body is
  treated as return value.

### Type inference in lambdas

- Kotlin’s type inference helps the compiler to evaluate the type of lambda expression.
- Below is the lambda expression using which we can compute the sum of two integers.
- val sum = {a: Int , b: Int -> a + b}
- (Int,Int) -> String

```
    val lambda1: (Int) -> Int = (a -> a * a)
    val lambda2: (String,String) -> String = { a , b -> a + b }
    val lambda3: (Int)-> Unit = {print(Int)}
```

- Lambdas can be used as class extension :

```
    val lambda4 : String.(Int) -> String = { this + it }
    
    fun main(args: Array<String>) {
        val result = "Geeks".lambda4(50)
        print(result)
    }
OUTPUT = Geeks50
```
## Anonymous Function
- An anonymous function is very similar to regular function except for the name of the function which is omitted from the declaration. The body of the anonymous function can be either an expression or block.
- Syntax

```
    fun(a: Int, b: Int) : Int = a * b
    
    or
    
    fun(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
        val mul = a * b
        return mul
    }
```

## Kotlin Tail Recursion
- 

## Classes and Objects

- A class in Kotlin can have a primary constructor and one or more secondary constructors. The
  primary constructor is part of the class header: it goes after the class name (and optional type
  parameters).

```
    class Person constructor(firstName: String) {
    }
```

- **NOTE**
- **If the primary constructor does not have any annotations or visibility modifiers, the
  constructor keyword can be omitted:

```
    class Person(firstName: String) {
    }
```

- **NOTE-** The primary constructor cannot contain any code. Initialization code can be placed in
  initializer blocks, which are prefixed with the init keyword.

## Secondary Constructors

- The class can also declare secondary constructors, which are prefixed with constructor:

```
    class Person {
        constructor(parent: Person) {
            parent.children.add(this)
        }
    }
```

- **NOTE** If the class has a primary constructor, each secondary constructor needs to delegate to
  the primary constructor, either directly or indirectly through another secondary constructor(s).
  Delegation to another constructor of the same class is done using the this keyword:

```
    class Person(val name: String) {
        constructor(name: String, parent: Person) : this(name) {
            parent.children.add(this)
        }
    }
```

- **NOTE:Note that code in initializer blocks effectively becomes part of the primary constructor**
- **NOTE-** If you want to declare a constructor as private , then u can declare as below

```
    class DontCreateMe private constructor () {
    }
```

- **NOTE:** you can declare constructor with default parameters

```
    class Customer(val customerName: String = "SibaPrasad"){
      init{
        println(customerName)
        }
      }
```

- in the above case, if we will not pass any value to the constructor, it will assign the default
  value
- var cons = Customer()// it will print SIbaprasad
- var cons = Customer("Mohanty")// it will print Mohanty

## Class Members

- Classes can contain:

1) Constructors and initializer blocks
2) Functions
3) Properties
4) Nested and Inner Classes
5) Object Declarations

## Inheritance

- All classes in Kotlin have a common superclass Any, that is the default superclass for a class
  with no supertypes declared:

```
class Example // Implicitly inherits from Any
```

- **Note:** Any is not java.lang.Object; in particular, it does not have any members other than
  equals(), hashCode() and toString(). Please consult the Java interoperability section for more
  details.
- **NOTE : The open annotation on a class is the opposite of Java's final:**

```
    open class Base(p: Int)
    
    class Derived(p: Int) : Base(p)
```

- **NOTE:** If the derived class has a primary constructor, the base class can (and must) be
  initialized right there, using the parameters of the primary constructor.

- If the class has no primary constructor, then each secondary constructor has to initialize the
  base type using the super keyword, or to delegate to another constructor which does that. Note
  that in this case different secondary constructors can call different constructors of the base
  type:

```
class MyView : View {
    constructor(ctx: Context) : super(ctx)

    constructor(ctx: Context, attrs: AttributeSet) : super(ctx, attrs)
}
```

## Overriding Methods

- As we mentioned before, we stick to making things explicit in Kotlin. And unlike Java, Kotlin
  requires explicit annotations for overridable members (we call them open) and for overrides:

```
open class Base {
    open fun v() {}
    fun nv() {}
}
class Derived() : Base() {
    override fun v() {}
}
```

## Collections*

- Array is Mutable and fixed size
- Note : There are 2 types of collections in Kotlin

1. imMutable Collection - Read Only Operation
    - Immutable List - listOf
    - Immutable map - mapOf
    - immutable set - setOf

2. Mutable Collection - read and Write Operation
    - Mutable List  : ArrayList,arrayListOf,mutableListOf
    - Mutable Map   : HashMap,HashmapOf,MutableMapOf
    - Mutable Set : HashsetOf,mutableSetOf

## How to define Array

```
    var myArray:Array<Int>(5){0}  - all elements are zero
    
     myArray[0] = 123
     for(element in myArray){
        print(element)
     }
```

## Define List

```
 var list:listOf<String>("Siba","Prasad","mohanty")
 // this is immutable list,fixed in size. cant perform add or remove
 list(1) = "asdas" // it will show error, we cant change

 var mutableList:mutableListOf<String>("a","b","c")
 // this is mutable list,can change sizee. can perform add or remove
 mutableList.add("d")
 mutableList.remove(0)

 var listExample:arrayListOf<String>("india","Canada","uk")
 // we can also declare mutable list like this
 listExample.add("asdsad")
 listExample.add("def")
```

- we can perform all the operation in the mutable list
- var mutableArrayList:Arraylist<String>("a","b","c")

## Map

## immutable Map

- can't change size of the map
- can't perform operation
- Fixed in size
- **Example**

```
  var immutableMap:mapOf<Integer,String>(2 to "two",3 to "three", 1 to "one")
  immutableMap.put(1 to "12321") / it will show error
```

## mutable Map

```
  var mutableMapType1:HashMap<Integer,String>(2 to "two",3 to "three", 1 to "one")
  mutableMapType1.put(3 to "sibaprasad")
  mutableMapType1.replace(2 to "aaa")

  var mutableMapType2:HashmapOf<Float,Integer>(2.2f to 2,3.5f to 7)

  var mutableMapType3:MutableMapOf<String,String>("siba" to "prasad","prasad" to "mohanty", "abc" to "def")
```

- **Now retrieve the map values**

```
 for(key in mutableMapType1.keys){
  println("Element at $key is ${mutableMapType1[key]}")
 }
```

## Define SET

- set contains Unique Element
- Hashset contains unique element but cant guaranty of the sequence of element

## Mutable Set

```
 var mutableSet:setOf<String>("a","b","c","dsadasdas")  // its can be read and write both
  var mutableSet:setOf<Integer>(1,2,3,12,3,4,5)
 mutableSet.remove(5)
 mutableSet.add(100)

 for(value i mutableSet){
 print("Value is $value")
 }
```

## Extension Function

- Kotlin's extension functions will let us add new functions to existing classes that would not be
  able to be modified otherwise. We can, for instance, add a new method to an activity that let us
  show a toast in a much more simple nomenclature:

```
     fun Activity.toast(message: CharSequence, duration: Int = Toast.LENGTH_SHORT){
        Toast.makeText(this, message, duration) .show()
     }
```

- Explanation : To create a toast message, everytime we need to write the show method at the end of
  the com.swasi.play.function.
- But in the extension com.swasi.play.function we just write the com.swasi.play.function with extra
  default parameters like, duration and aded show method at the end
- Here it is another interesting example that will let me explain another interesting concept:
  reified types.

```
    inline fun <reified T : Activity> Activity.navigate(id: String) {
        val intent = Intent(this, T::class.java)
        intent.putExtra("id", id)
        startActivity(intent)
    }
```

- Inline functions can use reified types, what means that we can recover the class from a type
  inside the com.swasi.play.function instead of having to pass the class type as an argument.
- Inline functions are a bit different from regular functions. Inline functions will be substituted
  with its code during compilation, instead of really calling to a com.swasi.play.function. It will
  simplify some situations. For instance, if we have a com.swasi.play.function as an argument, a
  regular com.swasi.play.function will internally create an object that contains that
  com.swasi.play.function. On the other hand, inline functions will substitute the code of the
  com.swasi.play.function in the place where its called, so it won´t require an internal object for
  that.
