# Basics Of Kotlin
# Variables
- In kotlin use **var** to declare a variable which is mutable
- use **val** to declare constant values which can not be change.
- val, var must be assigned to value, otherwise it will show compile time error
```
var age : Int // initialize with some value, otherwise it will show compule time error
val name : String // it will show compile time error
```
- lateinit var must be define with datatype
- ```
  lateinit var address : String
  ```
## Difference between val and const
- **const** are compile time constants.
- Meaning that their value has to be assigned during compile time, unlike val , where it can be done at runtime.
- This means, that **const** can never be assigned to a function or any class constructor, but only to a String or primitive.
```
    const val foo = complexFunctionCall()   //Not okay
    val fooVal = complexFunctionCall()  //Okay
    const val bar = "Hello world"           //Also okay
```

## lateinit var
- lateinit can not be applicable to Primitive  Data Types(Byte, Short, Int, Long, Float, Double, Boolean)
- It's  only applicable to String,  data classes and  other classes
- To check if the variable is  initialized or  not, use this
```
lateinit var mydataclass : MyDataClass
if (this::mydataclass.isInitialized) {
  // mydataclass is initialized with value
}
```
- lateinit means late initialization. 
- If you do not want to initialize a variable in the constructor instead you want to initialize it later on and if you can guarantee the initialization before using it, then declare that variable with lateinit keyword. 
- It will not allocate memory until initialized.

## String Template
- You can use $ symbol to concat two string or values with strings
```
    val name = "Sibaprasad"
    val fullSentence  = "My Name is $name"
    val a = 12, b = 13
    val sumWord = "sum of $a and $b is ${a+b}"
```


## Nullable values and null checks
- A reference must be explicitly marked as nullable when null value is possible. Nullable type names have ? at the end.
- In Kotlin, the type system distinguishes between references that can hold null (nullable references)
  and those that can not (non-null references).
- For example, a normal property can’t hold a null value and will show a compile error.
  ``
  var variable : CustomClass = CustomClass()
  variable = null //compilation error
  ``
- Instead, we can add a ? after the data type of that property which declares that variable as a nullable property
```
    var nullableVariable : CustomClass? = CustomClass()
    nullableVariable = null //works fine
```
- In any case, the nullable property requires a null check every time before utilizing that property or
  requires a confirmation from the developer that the estimation of that property won’t be null
  while utilizing it

variable.someMethodCall() //works fine as the compiler is sure that
//the variable can’t be null nullableVariable.someMethodCall()
//will highlight compilation error
//as compiler is not sure as nullVariable can be null.

## ? Operator
- If a variable is nullable, use ? before accessing it.
```
    var name:String? = null
    val length = name?.length
```
- In the above case if name is not null, it will return length of the string
- If it's null, then length will be null
```
        val a5:String? = null
        val length5 = a5?.length
        print("Length of $a5 is $length5")
```
- Above length5 is null

## Elvis Operator (?:)
- This one is similar to safe calls except the fact that it can return a non-null value if the calling property is null even
```
    val result = nullableVariable?.someMethodCall()?: fallbackIfNullMethodCall()
    or
    var b:String? = "abcd"
    // if b is not null it the value is the length of the string
    // if b is null the value of l is -1 below
    val l = b?.length ?: -1
```

## !! Operator
- This operator is used to explicitly tell the compiler that the property is not null and if it’s null, please throw a null pointer exception (NPE)
- nullableVariable!!.someMethodCall()
- Above call will throw an runtime exception
- When we use !! operator to handle the null pointer, we have to sound the block of code by try catch
```
    try{
        nullableVariable!!.someMethodCall()
       }
       catch(e:Exception){
        // handle exception here
       }
```

## Handle null using let operator
```
val name:String  = null
val length = name?.let {
            it.length
        }
print("Length of $name is $length");

```
- In the above statement it will print
- Length of null is null
- length value will be null

## Type checks and automatic casts
- **is**, **!is** is used for type check.
```
    val name = "Siba"
    if(name is String){
        println("$name is a string")
    }

    if(name !is String){
            println("$name is not a string")
      }
```
- **as**, **as?** is used for type casts.
- as operator is used to type cast other types
- as is unsafe typecast and as? is a safe typecast operator.
```
val name = "Siba"
val nameString = name as String.

val age = 32
val ageString = age as String.
```
- In the above case it will cast to string.
- In the second case it will throw an error that it can not be convert to string.
- class java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to class java.lang.String

# Idioms
## Dataclass
- It is a data container same as pojo/model class in java
```
    data class Customer(val name: String, val email: String)
```
- provides a Customer class with the following functionality:
- getters (and setters in case of vars) for all properties
- These are the default properties created by compiler automatically
    - equals()
    - hashCode()
    - toString()
    - copy()
    - component1(), component2(), ..., for all properties (see Data classes)

## Default value for function parameters
- You can declare a default value for a function parameter.
```
    fun foo(a: Int = 0, b: String = "") { ... }
```
## Filtering a list
- val positives = list.filter { x -> x > 0 }
- or val positives = list.filter { it > 0 }

## Check the presence of an element in collections
- in operator is used to check if an item is present in a collection
```
    if ("siba@example.com" in emailsList) {
        println("siba@example.com is present in the collection")
    }
```
```
    if ("siba@example.com" in emailsList) {
        println("siba@example.com is not present in the collection")
    }
```
## Read-only list
- val list = listOf("a", "b", "c")
## Read-only map
- val map = mapOf("a" to 1, "b" to 2, "c" to 3)
## Access a map entry
```
    println(map["key"])
    map["key"] = value
```
## Traverse a map or a list of pairs
```
    for ((k, v) in map) {
       println("$k -> $v")
    }
```
## Iterate over a range
- Range is used for a range of values
```
    for (i in 1..100) { ... }  // closed range: includes 100
    for (i in 1 until 100) { ... } // half-open range: does not include 100
    for (x in 2..10 step 2) { ... }
    for (x in 10 downTo 1) { ... }
    (1..10).forEach { ... }
```
## Lazy property
```
    val p: String by lazy {
        // compute the string
    }
```
## Extension functions
```
    fun String.spaceToCamelCase() { ... }
    "Convert this to camelcase".spaceToCamelCase()
```
## Create a singleton
```
   object Resource {
       val name = "Name"
   }
```

## Instantiate an abstract class
```
   abstract class MyAbstractClass {
       abstract fun doSomething()
       abstract fun sleep()
   }

   fun main() {
       val myObject = object : MyAbstractClass() {
           override fun doSomething() {
               // ...
           }

           override fun sleep() { // ...
           }
       }
       myObject.doSomething()
   }
```

## Data types
## Numbers
    - Byte   - 8 bits   - (2 power 8) to +(2 power 8)-1
    - Short  - 16 bits  - (2 power 16) to +(2 power 16)-1
    - Int    - 32 bits  - (2 power 32) to +(2 power 32)-1
    - Long   - 64 bits  - (2 power 64) to +(2 power 64)-1
```
    val one = 1 // Int
    val threeBillion = 3000000000 // Long
    val oneLong = 1L // Long
    val oneByte: Byte = 1
```

## Decimals
    - Float  32 bits, 6-7 decimal points
    - Double 64 bits, 15-16 decimal places
```
    val pi = 3.14 // Double
    // val one: Double = 1 // Error: type mismatch
    val oneDouble = 1.0 // Double
```

- **NOTE** Numbers can be convert to another type with the below methods
    - toByte(): Byte
    - toShort(): Short
    - toInt(): Int
    - toLong(): Long
    - toFloat(): Float
    - toDouble(): Double
    - toChar(): Char
## NaN
    - NaN is considered equal to itself
    - NaN is considered greater than any other element including POSITIVE_INFINITY
    - 0.0 is considered less than 0.0

## Booleans
    || – disjunction (logical OR)

    && – conjunction (logical AND)

    ! - negation (logical NOT)
## Characters

## Strings


```
val text = """
    |Tell me and I forget.
    |Teach me and I remember.
    |Involve me and I learn.
    |(Benjamin Franklin)
    """.trimMargin()
```
- String template
```
val s = "abc"
println("$s.length is ${s.length}")
```
## Arrays
- Arrays in Kotlin are represented by the Array class.
- It has get and set functions that turn into [] by operator overloading conventions, and the size property, along with other useful member functions:
- Array class look like this
```
class Array<T> private constructor() {
    val size: Int
    operator fun get(index: Int): T
    operator fun set(index: Int, value: T): Unit

    operator fun iterator(): Iterator<T>
    // ...
}
```
- You can create array like this
```
val intArray = arrayOf<Int>(1,2,4,5)
val intArray - intArrayOf(1,2,4)
val arrayOfZeros = IntArray(size) //equivalent in Java: new int[size]
val numbersFromOne = IntArray(size) { it + 1 }
val myInts = intArrayOf(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)

```

## Type checks and casts
## is and !is operators
- Use the is operator or its negated form !is to perform a runtime check that identifies whether an object conforms to a given type:
```
    if (obj is String) {
        print(obj.length)
    }

    if (obj !is String) { // same as !(obj is String)
        print("Not a String")
    } else {
        print(obj.length)
    }
```
-

## Smart casts

## "Unsafe" cast operator
- as is used as unsafe cast operator
- val x: String = y as String
- val x: String? = y as String?
## ## "Safe" nullable cast operator
- as? is used as safe cast operator
- val x: String? = y as? String

## Pair
- Pair is a predefined class in Kotlin that is used to store and return two variables at a time.
- Those two variables can be of the same type or of a different type. So, whenever you want to return more than one variable from a function then you can use Pair in your function. But how to use Pair?
- Let’s have a look at how to use Pair in Kotlin:
```
    Pair ("Hello", "Kotlin") // here both the variables are of type string
    Pair ("Kotlin", 1) // here 1st variable is of type string and other is type of integer
    Pair (2, 20) // here both the variables are of integer type

    val variable1 = "Declaring String variable"
    val variable2 = 1 // declaring integer value
    Pair (variable1, variable2) // using declared variable in Pair class
```
- You can convert a pair to toString and toList
```
 val variable1 = "Declaring String variable"
 val variable2 = 1 // declaring integer value
 val pair = Pair (variable1, variable2) // using declared variable in Pair class
 pair.toString()
 pair.toList();
```

## Triple
- Triple is another predefined class in Kotlin. With the help of Triple class in Kotlin, you can return 3 variables of same or different type from one function.
- Also, you can use Triple class to store 3 variables of same or different type.
- The use of Triple is the same as that of Pair in Kotlin.
- Following example shows the use of Triple in Kotlin:
```
    val variable1 = "Declaring String variable"
    val variable2 = 1 // declaring integer value
    val variable3 = "Declaring second string value"

    val variableName = Triple (variable1, variable2, variable3) // using declared variable in Triple class

    println(variableName.first) // will print the value of variable1
    println(variableName.second) // will print the value of variable2
    println(variableName.third) // will print the value of variable3
```
- Same as pair you can convert a triple to toString and toList
