# Oops Interview Questions

- What are the main features of OOPs?
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Data Abstraction

## What is oops ?

- Object-Oriented programming System(OOPS) is a programming paradigm based o the concept of objects
  that contain data and method.
- The primary purpose of object-oriented programming is to increase the flexibility maintainability
  of program.
- OOP brings together data and it's behaviour(methods) in a single location(object) makes it easier
  to understand how a program works.

## Core modules of oops

- Object
- Class
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation

## Object

- Any entity that has state and behaviour is known as an object. for example a chair, pen, table,
  keyboard bike etc. IT CAN BE PHYSICAL OR LOGICAL.
- An object can be defined as an instance of a class.
- An object contains an address ad takes up some space in memory.
- Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each other's data or code.

## Class

- Collection of objects called class. It is a logical entity.
- A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create individual object.
- Class does not consume any space.

## Inheritance

- When an object acquires all the properties and behaviour of parent object, itt is known as
  inheritance.
- It provides code usability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.

## Polymorphism

- If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism.
- eg : to convince the consumer differently, to draw something, for example shape, triangle, square
  etc.
- In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.

## Abstraction

- Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction.
- For example, phone call, we don't know the internal processing.
- In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.

## Encapsulation

- Binding(wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation.
- A Java class is the example of encapsulation
