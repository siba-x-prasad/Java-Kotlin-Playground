# Kotlin introduction
## How Java works
- TestClass.java is compiled by javac (Java compiler).
- Javac compiles Java source file into Java byte-code file as TestClass.class.
- Java byte-code file (TestClass.class) ends up in JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
- JVM understands byte-code and converts it into machine code, using JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler.
- The machine code is then fed to the memory and executed by computer’s central processing unit.
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** — engine which provides runtime environment for execution of Java code.
- **JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler** — type of compiler which does the compilation during the execution of a program (compiles the app when user opens it).

## How Kotlin works
- .kt file is compiled by Kotlin compiler
- It creates .class file which is nothing but the byte code which is interpreted by JVM
- That byte code executed by JVM

- Does kotlin create a class internally ?
- Yes, The kotlin compiler internally creates a class file which is loaded into memory for execution in runtime.
- Let's create a Hello.kt kotlin file and while executing it converts to Hellokt.class file to execute the class file by JVM

## Advantage of Kotlin Over Java
- It's Completely Interoperable With Java
- It's (way) More Concise Than Java
  - This is not to mention all the other benefits that derive from code conciseness, including code that is:
      - Easier to maintain
      - Easier to read
      - Easier to apply changes to when needed
    - Some of Kotlin's features that are “responsible” for its code conciseness are:
      - Data classes ( data class MyData())
      - Smart casts (using as, as?, is, is?)
      - Type interface
      - Properties
- Safer Code
- It Comes With a Smarter and Safer Compiler
  - Detects errors at compile time, not at runtime, leveraging the “fail-fast” principle
  - Performs lots of checks, reducing runtime errors and the number of bugs in the code
- It's Easier to Maintain
- It's Been Created to Boost Your Productivity
  - Object declarations
  - Parameter values
  - Extension functions
- It “Spoils” You with Better Support for Functional Programming
- It Has Null in Its Type System

## Latest Kotlin Version 1.7.0
- The new Kotlin K2 compiler is in Alpha now, and it offers serious performance improvements. It is available only for the JVM, and none of the compiler plugins, including kapt, work with it.
- A new approach to the incremental compilation in Gradle. Incremental compilation is now also supported for changes made inside dependent non-Kotlin modules and is compatible with Gradle.
- We've stabilized opt-in requirement annotations, definitely non-nullable types, and builder inference.
- There's now an underscore operator for type args. You can use it to automatically infer a type of argument when other types are specified.
- This release allows implementation by delegation to an inlined value of an inline class. You can now create lightweight wrappers that do not allocate memory in most cases.

## A multiplatform language
- Kotlin is a multiplatform language.
- JVM: Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, which means Kotlin works great with all existing Java code and libraries. It also allows companies to make a gradual migration from Java to Kotlin because Java code can access Kotlin code, too. At the same time, developers can use Kotlin as the only language for their projects without Java at all.
- Android: using Kotlin, you can create mobile applications for the most used operating system in the world.
- JS: Kotlin is also compatible with JavaScript, which enables you to develop client-side web applications and run them in a browser.
- Native: Kotlin code can be converted into a file that can be run on any OS such as Windows, Linux, iOS, and macOS.

## Basic Program
```
  fun main() {
      println("Hello, Kotlin!")
  }
  
  OR

  fun main(args: Array<String>) {
      println(args.contentToString())
  }
```
